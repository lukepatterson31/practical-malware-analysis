# Static Analysis Techniques

### AV scanning

Run malware through AV scanners, good to check.

### Hashing

Identify malware by it's hash, MD5 or SHA-1 usually.

### Finding Strings

Find strings in executables, discovering clues and human readable text

### Packed and Obfuscated Malware

Detect packers with PEiD (unsupported) or Unpac.me

`upx` is a packing program

### Portable Executable File Format

File format used by Windows executables, object code and DLLs. It's a data structure 
containing the inofmration for the Windows OS loader to manage the wrapped executable code.
PE files begin with a header including information about the code, type of application, 
required library functions and space requirements.

### Linked Libraries

Static (all dependencies included in binary), Runtime (loads dependency on function call)
and Dynamic (loads on program start) libraries.

Some Windows functions allow importing of linked functions not listed in the program's file 
header. The two most common are `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`. `LdrGetProcAddress` and 
`LdrLoadDll` are also used. `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress` allow a program to access any
function in any library on the system; When these functions are used you can't tell 
statically which funtions are being used by the suspect program.

The PE file header contains information about every library that will be loaded and every 
function that will be used by the program.
